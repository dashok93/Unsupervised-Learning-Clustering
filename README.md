## Clustering - Unsupervised Learning

Clustering, which is an unsupervised learning method, is where we simply identify similar instances of the data and keep them together while we label them and find relevant action plans if possible for each sub groups. Within the clusters, the items are always expected to be homogenous. 

The goal overall for anyone performing Clustering is to determine the intrinsic groups of data, irrespective of the features which we have in the data. What makes a good cluster is not a question which can be directly answered, since there is no such best criterion for cluster validation. 

**Applications**

- Customer segmentation. 
- Exploratory data analysis. 
- Dimensionality reduction. 
- Anomaly Detection. 
- Search Engines
- Image Segmentation

and there are many more, while the above are only the common use cases. 

**Rules**

... or, these are the main requirements of performing clustering activities. 

1. scalable. 
2. should be able to deal with attributes of different types. 
3. should be able to discover arbitrary shaped clusters also. 
4. should have (at least some) ability to deal with outliers. 
5. clusters which we create should not vary with the order of input records. 
6. should be able to handle higher dimensions of data... *
7. finally, should be easy to interpret. 



**Bifurcations**

Basis the appproach which we follow during clustering, there are 2 types of clustering methods: 

- Agglomerative
- Divisive

Basis the clear demarcation of data points within and outside the cluster, there are 3 types of clustering methods: 

- Exclusive Clustering 
- Overlapping Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
